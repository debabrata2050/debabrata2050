#### ❤️ Programming Relationship Status:
- **Java** – My *first crush*. It was intense, confusing, but unforgettable.
- **C** – Had a little *flinch* in college. Short-lived. No hard feelings.
- **C++** – My DSA partner. Strong, logical, but emotionally unavailable.
- **Python** – Currently *hanging out*. Feels like “the one” 💍

#### 🧠 Fun Facts:
- If my code works on the first try, I double-check if I’m dreaming.
- My Git commit messages range from `"Fixed it!"` to `"pls work this time bro 😭"`
- Life goal: Write code so clean, even my future self doesn’t roast me.
